<!-- * Add six buttons to the student_dashboard.
* All the buttons submit to the same action, with one param but with different values. params[:student][:score] == 4
* The one action can be students#update
* The trick is the redirect.
* On student dashboard, show one of the buttons as the selected one, based on the current user's score.

* AFTER THAT: Teacher can reset all scores. -->
